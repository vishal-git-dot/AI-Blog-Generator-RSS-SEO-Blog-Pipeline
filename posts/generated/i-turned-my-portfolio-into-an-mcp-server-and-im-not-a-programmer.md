# I turned my portfolio into an MCP server (and I'm not a programmer)

## Overview

I turned my portfolio into an MCP server (and I'm not a programmer) My background is civil engineering. I don't write code — I direct AI agents to write it while I handle architecture, decisions, and QA. So when I built my portfolio, I didn't want it to look like everyone else's. I wanted it to do something no one else's does. Here's what I built: a portfolio that answers questions from AI agents directly. Not a chatbot. Not a demo. A real server that any AI — Claude, GPT, anything — can connect to and interrogate. claude mcp add --transport http msp-portfolio \ https://msp-portfolio.mansio-dev.workers.dev/mcp Ask it "what has Mikhail built?" or "does his stack match this job description?" and it answers with live data — not a frozen PDF from six months ago. The problem I was solving Every portfolio makes the same silent promise: "trust that this is still true." It's a snapshot. The moment you close the editor, it starts going stale. And there's no way for anyone — human or AI recruiter — to verify what's actually there. I wanted the opposite. A portfolio that doesn't just display claims, but answers questions about them. If the evidence for a skill isn't there, it says so instead of bluffing. What I actually built The site has three parts that share the same brain: 1. The website — what you see when you open it in a browser. Interactive, dark-themed, with a simulator you can break. 2. A server for AI agents — the same data, but in a format any AI can query directly. This is the MCP part. 3. A local version — for development and testing from the command line. The unusual thing: all three read from exactly the same source. No copy-pasting, no "API version" vs "website version." One place, three doors. The nine tools Think of these as questions the AI can ask my portfolio: Question Tool Who is Mikhail? get_profile What has he built? get_projects What has he been working on lately? get_commit_history What are his engineering principles? get_engineering_principles What has he written recently? get_articles What mistakes has he made? get_antipatterns How does his stack match this job? analyze_stack What decisions did he make and when? get_timeline What happens to his architecture under load? simulate_architecture The one recruiters use most: analyze_stack . You paste a job description, it returns a per-skill breakdown with actual evidence — not "I know Kubernetes" but "used in project X, decision log here." The one I'm most proud of: get_antipatterns . It's a museum of real mistakes I made while building this — a forked repo I accidentally claimed as mine, a feature that worked in local tests and silently broke in production, a counter that looked like it was writing data and wasn't. Honest lessons, not a polished highlight reel. The simulator The portfolio has a live architecture simulator. You pick one of my real projects, pick a failure scenario — kill a node, freeze the cache, overload the AI — and watch the performance numbers change in real time. It's not a video. It's not a screenshot. It runs the actual model. At 20× load on the search architecture: p95 latency goes from ~10ms to 239ms under a load spike, 401ms if a node dies. When it crosses a threshold, a chip appears: circuit_open , fallback_engaged , degraded_mode . This is what I mean when I say "I understand distributed systems" — you can verify it yourself. What broke (the honest part) The package that doesn't exist. I spent time trying to install @fastify/mcp . It doesn't exist. The real name is @modelcontextprotocol/fastify . Simple mistake, cost an hour. The function that worked locally and did nothing in production. I had a counter that tracked how many times the MCP server was queried. It passed all tests. In production, the counter never wrote anything. Reason: in Cloudflare Workers, code that runs after you send a response gets cancelled immediately. My counter was running after the response. Fix: one line — ctx.waitUntil(task) . The lesson is that local Node.js and Cloudflare Workers have different rules about what happens after a request ends. The rate limiter that reported success but did nothing. I set up a rate limit on the free plan. Every call returned success: true . Enforcement simply wasn't active at that tier. I only caught it by deliberately triggering it with a burst test. Configuration saying "yes" and the system actually enforcing it are two different things. The hourly commit that silently moved the code forward without me. The CI runs every hour to refresh metrics. Each run makes a commit. If I pushed without fetching first, I'd be pushing on top of a diverged history. Now I always git fetch first. Not a disaster, just a thing you learn once. One thing I didn't expect The agent loop — where you can type a question and watch the AI call tools step by step, live, in the browser — turned out to be the most interesting part to watch. You see it think. It calls get_profile , reads the result, decides it needs more, calls analyze_stack , compares, then answers. The whole chain is visible. It's not a black box with an answer at the end. It's a process you can audit. I didn't plan that as a feature. It came from trying to debug the demo and realizing the debug view was more interesting than the final answer. Try it Portfolio: mansio.github.io/MSPortfolio Source: github.com/ManSio/MSPortfolio Add to Claude: claude mcp add --transport http msp-portfolio \ https://msp-portfolio.mansio-dev.workers.dev/mcp Then ask it: "what did your mistakes teach you?" If you build something like this, drop a comment. I'd genuinely like to see it.
