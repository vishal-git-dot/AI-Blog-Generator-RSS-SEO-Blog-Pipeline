# I Built an AI-Native Trading Engine in Python. Here's How It Works

## Overview

I Built an AI-Native Trading Engine in Python. Here's How It Works 9 strategies, 24/7 WebSocket monitoring, AI scoring, and full agent-based orchestration. Open source, MIT. Why I Built This Trading bots are either black-box subscriptions at $50/month, or DIY scripts that break at 3 AM. I wanted a system that: Runs unattended — fire and forget Understands context — not just "RSI < 30 = buy", but scoring across 9 metrics Responds to voice/text — "go AVAX x10" and the AI agent executes everything Is open source — so anyone can fork and customize That's how bybit-ws was born — an AI-native trading engine for Bybit.

Not a 5,000-line monolith, but 30+ files with clear responsibilities. 9 Strategies — From Conservative to Extreme Strategy Leverage Timeframe Signal Bollinger Grid LONG 3x Daily Lower BB −3% Bollinger Grid SHORT 3x Daily BB >85% Junk Short 3x Daily Pump ≥80% SL Re-entry 3x Daily Lower BB after stop DCA Ladder 3x — −5/−10/−15% from entry ⚡ BB Scalping 10x M5 Band touch + RSI filter ⚡ Mean Reversion 10x Daily BB% <5% or >95% ⚡ Funding Momentum 10x Daily Extreme funding rate ⚡ ATR Risk Sizing layer 15m Validation: SL = 1.5×ATR The golden rule: the system doesn't guess. Every entry passes through scoring across 8+ metrics : Tier bonus (S/A/B/C/D token) BB% position (0–100%) 24h volume RSI(14) Funding rate BB Squeeze (band compression) Consecutive down days Weekly/monthly BB% Minimum threshold: 5.5/10 . Anything below — the system silently skips. AI Integration: More Than Buttons The interesting part is the AI layer. I use Hermes Agent (by Nous Research) as the orchestrator: MCP Server : the agent sees positions, orders, and metrics through a standardized protocol REST API : port 8766, CORS, rate-limiting, RPC token Auto-entry : the agent decides on entries based on scoring GridSignal Bot (@GridSignalBot on Telegram): real-time scanner, LONG/SHORT/x10 buttons Example interaction: Me: "go AVAX x10 at market" Agent: checks BB%, RSI, funding, correlations → scoring 7.2/10 → OK → calculates: margin=$5, qty=15.1, SL=−5% → order placed: 53e99c39 All via voice or text. While driving, on shift, in the shower — doesn't matter. Numbers & Hardware Python 3.11 , systemd service WebSocket — real-time data from Bybit 30-second light cycle — positions, orders, health 7-minute heavy cycle — scoring, BB, RSI, squeeze, auto-entry Memory : ~200 MB at runtime Uptime : weeks without restart Roadmap 🔜 Telegram Mini App — dashboard right in Telegram 🔜 Paper trading mode — risk-free testing 🔜 Docker one-liner — docker run and done 🔮 OKX/Binance support — multi-exchange Try It git clone https://github.com/poliakarmai/bybit-ws cd bybit-ws cp config.example.yaml config.yaml # insert your Bybit API keys systemctl --user enable --now bybit-ws GitHub: poliakarmai/bybit-ws Bot: @GridSignalBot License: MIT Questions? Open an issue, message the Telegram bot, or fork and customize. The code is alive, trades real money, and improves every day.
