# Measure, Don't Estimate: Labeling Speakers Without a Gated Model

## Overview

In the first post I argued there are two ways to pull meaning out of audio: measure it with signal processing, or estimate it with a model. This post is the story of a problem where the obvious move was to estimate — and where measuring turned out to be better. The problem: labeling who is speaking. A transcript that says "Agent: …" and "Customer: …" is far more useful than an undifferentiated wall of text. Splitting a conversation by speaker is called diarization . The obvious tool, and why it hurt The strong, well-known tool for diarization is pyannote . It's genuinely good. It is also gated : to run it you need a Hugging Face account, an access token, and to accept a license agreement before the weights will download. That's fine for a production deployment. It's a terrible first impression for someone who just pip install -ed your library and wants to see it work. Without a token, every single turn comes back labeled "unknown" . The newcomer's first run is a wall of unknown: … and they bounce. So I wanted a default path that works with zero setup, and lets you opt into pyannote when you have a token and want the best quality. Shortcut #1: just alternate speakers (this fails) My first instinct was the dumbest possible heuristic: in a two-party call, the speakers take turns, so just alternate Agent , Customer , Agent , Customer … It fell apart immediately. Speech recognizers like Whisper segment on sentences , not speakers . So the agent's multi-sentence greeting — "Hi there! Thanks for calling. How can I help you today?" — gets split into three segments, and the naive alternator flip-flops the label mid-utterance: Agent: Hi there! Customer: Thanks for calling. Agent: How can I help you today? Garbage. The structure I assumed (one segment per speaker turn) simply isn't there. Shortcut #2: ask what signal is actually present Instead of forcing a model-shaped solution, I asked: what's physically in the audio that distinguishes these two speakers? In a typical support call, the agent and the customer have noticeably different voice pitch . That's a physical property of the waveform — exactly the kind of thing signal processing measures cheaply and exactly. So the approach becomes: For each transcribed segment, measure its average pitch (fundamental frequency) using an audio library I already had as a dependency. Cluster the segments into two groups by pitch. The low-pitch cluster is one speaker, the high-pitch cluster is the other. The core of it is just a measurement plus a 2-way split: import librosa import numpy as np def segment_pitch ( y : np . ndarray , sr : int ) -> float : """ Mean fundamental frequency (Hz) of one transcript segment. """ f0 , voiced_flag , _ = librosa . pyin ( y , fmin = float ( librosa . note_to_hz ( " C2 " )), fmax = float ( librosa . note_to_hz ( " C7 " )), sr = sr , ) voiced = f0 [ voiced_flag ] return float ( np . nanmean ( voiced )) if voiced . size else 0.0 def assign_speakers ( pitches : list [ float ], labels = ( " AI Agent " , " Customer " )): """ Split segments into two speakers by a pitch threshold. """ valid = [ p for p in pitches if p > 0 ] if not valid : return [ " unknown " ] * len ( pitches ) threshold = float ( np . median ( valid )) # Lower-pitched cluster -> first label, higher -> second. return [ labels [ 0 ] if ( p > 0 and p <= threshold ) else labels [ 1 ] if p > 0 else " unknown " for p in pitches ] A few dozen lines. No new dependency. No token. And the labels come out right for the common case — a plain measurement standing in for a model I couldn't assume the user had. It isn't magic — and that's the point Two similar voices (two men, two women, a deep-voiced customer) can fool the pitch split. With a token, pyannote still does better, and it handles three-plus speakers, overlapping speech, and edge cases this never will. So AudioTrace keeps both paths: import audiotrace # Default: zero-setup, infer speakers by pitch. report = audiotrace . analyze ( " call.wav " , diarize = False , num_speakers = 2 ) # Best quality: opt into pyannote with a token. report = audiotrace . analyze ( " call.wav " , hf_token = " hf_... " ) The lesson I keep relearning: we grab the biggest model out of habit. A careful look at the data often points to something lighter, cheaper, and easier to reason about. "What signal is actually there?" is a more useful question than "which model should I download?" That's also a practical observability principle. The cheap, deterministic measurement runs in milliseconds with no GPU, which means you can run it on every call — and the things you can afford to run on every call are the things that actually catch regressions. What's next We now have a structured CallReport with speakers, quality, sentiment, latency, and cost. In the final post I'll wire it into CI: fail the build when a prompt change makes the agent slower, colder, or less compliant , and emit the signals as OpenTelemetry spans alongside your LangChain / LangSmith traces. pip install audiotrace ⭐ Repo: github.com/dimastatz/audiotrace Keep building!
