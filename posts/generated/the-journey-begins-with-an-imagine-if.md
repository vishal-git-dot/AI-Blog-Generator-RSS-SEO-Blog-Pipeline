# The journey begins with an Imagine If.

## Overview

Follow the notes upon the journey. At first sight marks one's destiny. Return lies within the hasty keys. A few months ago, I was moving between customer sites, talking through our New Agent Design in Workflow. The questions kept repeating: why not OpenClaw? How is this different from Hermes Agent? It was not the first time I felt a little lost. Eventually I realized the confusion was not about one tool. It was about a boundary we had not named clearly enough: when is Agent Work just a delivery, and when should it become part of a production system? For many consumer scenarios, building a component library ahead of time is too expensive. If the need is one-off, and you are not sure the same problem will appear again in three months, Claude Code or Codex is often enough. You do not need to abstract first. You do not need to build an app before delivering the result. Sometimes I tell customers to make the problem smaller. "This does not need to be so complicated. Claude Code can solve it. If the problem comes back, write a skill. That may be the smallest useful investment." I still believe that. But another thing slowly became visible: countless personal PCs started growing fragmented Agent solutions. They were experiments, but also artifacts. They depended on local environments, Session History, context, file copies, MCP tools, and skills. I can finish the task on my computer. If your environment matches mine, you can replay my experiment. But if this is how Agent artifacts move, what are they? Fast-moving goods? A local performance that only works on one stage? That was the real turn in our journey. We are not trying to platform every piece of Agent Work. Quite the opposite: we want to respect the threshold. In an image, grayscale describes how bright or dark a pixel is. Usually 0 is pure black, and 255 is pure white. Agent Apps have a similar threshold. Below it, the right answer is a one-off app, a skill, a local delivery, a place where you should avoid unnecessary complexity. Above it, the work becomes building, evaluation, deployment, A/B testing, and production feedback. It needs a lifecycle. Once you cross that line, the tools become scattered. Developers have to stitch together point solutions: sandboxes, Eval Harnesses, deploy scripts, logs, permissions, context, UI, and functions where most of the real behavior still lives inside Prompt strings. At that point, you are no longer using Codex or Claude Code to solve your own problem. You are using them to build a production solution for your customer. You live inside harnesses and dependencies. You open terminals, worktrees, or a new ADE, trying to keep the work moving. That is when I kept asking myself: why is there no framework-agnostic "Supabase" for this? Not to replace builders, but to remove repeated Agent Runtime hosting, deployment, isolation, and evaluation from every app. Before cloud computing, building software felt like buying land, building a house, and running the property yourself. You bought servers, switches, and storage. You put them into a machine room or IDC before you could talk about the application. Agent App development is beginning the same journey. We used to wrap tokens into LLM API Calls and treat them as the smallest compute unit. Now we are wrapping tokens into requests against a Cloud Agent. Local consumer demand represented by tools like Hermes or OpenClaw will continue. But more complex production demand will move toward Cloud Agents in Sandboxes. It needs higher concurrency, longer-running jobs, stronger isolation, and background tasks that can be created, paused, resumed, evaluated, and deployed. We are re-abstracting cloud machine resources into a Cloud Agent Session Lifecycle API that developers can call directly. That is what we are building. Not another Agent Demo. Not another Prompt Wrapper. It is a value judgment: once Agent Work crosses the threshold, it should be hosted, isolated, observed, and reused like a cloud resource. We call it mosoo . The first piece of that work is now open source: mosoo Agent Driver. It is the driver layer we use to make OpenClaw, Hermes Agent, Claude Code, and Codex speak a compatible Agent Session API. Originally published on Mosoo Blog . Mosoo is an open-source managed agent runtime for deploying sandboxed agents behind an API.
