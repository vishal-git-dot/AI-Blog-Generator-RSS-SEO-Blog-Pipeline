# Multi-Agent Systems Architecture: Patterns, Pitfalls, and Production Reality

## Overview

An agent stuck in an infinite retry loop doesn't show up in your error rate. It shows up in your AWS bill — eleven days later. A team ran a multi-agent system for eleven days. Latency normal. Error rate 0.0%. Every dashboard green. Cloud bill: $47,000. The agents were stuck in an infinite retry loop the entire time — because "wrong" doesn't show up in Grafana. This incident is representative of a failure class unique to multi-agent architecture: agents operating correctly by every infrastructure metric while producing incorrect, looping, or redundant behavior at the application layer. When Multi-Agent Is Not the Answer Most teams reach for multi-agent too early. Stay with a single agent when: The task fits in one context window (200K Claude / 1M Gemini) Latency SLA is under 10 seconds Your single-agent baseline isn't tuned yet The work is sequential (no parallelism gain) You don't have observability infrastructure Multi-agent earns its complexity for: parallel subtasks, distinct tool access requirements, or failure isolation needs. The Four Coordination Patterns Orchestrator-Worker (~70% of production deployments): central planner decomposes tasks, dispatches to specialist workers, synthesizes results. Single point of failure but best observability. Sequential Pipeline : fixed linear chain. Deterministic, easy to debug, but latency stacks. Dynamic Handoff (Swarm) : no central coordinator — agents decide who handles what at runtime. Flexible but prone to infinite handoff loops. Hierarchical : orchestrators managing sub-orchestrators. For large-scale decomposition where a single orchestrator can't hold the full planning state. State Persistence: Demo vs Production The single capability that separates them: persisting intermediate results so workflows can pause, resume, and retry individual failed agents without restarting from scratch. Checkpoint at every task-level status transition to durable storage (Postgres, Temporal). Inter-Agent Contracts MCP for agent-to-tool communication. A2A for agent-to-agent. Beyond protocols: every handoff needs a typed, validated Pydantic model. Validation runs at the boundary — not three agents downstream when bad data causes inscrutable errors. Cost Controls Budget per workflow run — total token budget tracked and enforced across all agents Model tier routing — frontier model only for reasoning-heavy steps; Haiku for routing/classification/formatting Hard retry ceiling — attempt_count >= 3 terminates, not retries forever Sequential before parallel — fan-out increases total spend even when it reduces latency Observability: Detecting "Wrong" Standard metrics detect whether agents are running . Multi-agent systems need metrics that detect whether agents are making progress : Workflow completion rate — not error rate Retry anomaly detection — total retries significantly exceeding task count = stuck loop Cost per workflow run — token counts aggregated per workflow ID Per-agent failure rate — which role is the common failure point The $47K alert: flag any workflow where sum(attempt_count) > 2 * len(tasks) .
